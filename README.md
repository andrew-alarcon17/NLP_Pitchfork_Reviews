# NLP_Pitchfork_Reviews
I'm an avid viewer of Pitchfork music reviews, and I wanted to dive deeper into the scores of albums and how they vary from genre to genre, and year by year. I also wanted to see if there was an existing correlation between review length and the score of the review, and also the variation of scores from who wrote the reviews.
